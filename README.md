**Learn LangGraph and Knowledge Graphs through Biomedical AI**

An interactive educational project that teaches modern AI development through hands-on biomedical applications. Build AI agents that answer complex questions about genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs using graph databases and multi-step AI workflows.


## What You'll Learn

- **Knowledge Graphs**: Represent domain knowledge as nodes and relationships
- **LangGraph**: Build multi-step AI workflows with state management  
- **Cypher Queries**: Query graph databases effectively
- **AI Integration**: Combine language models with structured knowledge
- **Biomedical Applications**: Apply AI to drug discovery and personalized medicine

## Quick Start

1. **New to these concepts?** Read the [Foundations Guide](docs/foundations-and-background.md)
2. **Setup**: Follow [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for installation
3. **Learn**: Use the interactive Streamlit web interface
4. **Practice**: Work through the exercises in the web app

## Technology Stack

- **LangGraph**: AI workflow orchestration
- **Neo4j**: Graph database
- **Anthropic Claude**: Language model
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web interface
- **LangGraph Studio**: Visual debugging

## Installation

**Quick Setup**: Python 3.10+, Neo4j, PDM

```bash
# Install dependencies
pdm install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Load data and start
pdm run load-data
pdm run app
```

**Detailed instructions**: See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)

- **"Which genes encode proteins that are biomarkers for diseases?"**
- **"What drugs target proteins with high confidence disease associations?"**
- **"Which approved drugs target specific proteins?"**
- **"Which genes are linked to multiple disease categories?"**
- **"What proteins have causal associations with diseases?"**
