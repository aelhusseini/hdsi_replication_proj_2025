    "With traditional databases (tables), you might have:\n",
    "- `genes` table\n",
    "- `diseases` table  \n",
    "- `gene_disease_associations` table\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about complex questions like: **\"What pathway connects TP53 to Lisinopril through proteins and diseases?\"**\n",

    "### Knowledge Graphs: A Better Way\n",
